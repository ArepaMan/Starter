This project had the goal of mimicking the initial google search page (google.com) as a way to learn HTML and CSS.

This is my attempt at learning by doing instead of watching.

The project involved the creation of an account in netify to host the page which can be found here: https://663efb5b329d2aa17ace1986--chic-puffpuff-ac1e78.netlify.app/

It also involved learning how to make use of tailwindcss.com and fontawesome.com.

Next steps would be to develop a website that will show-case my progress in my journey to learn how to program in different languages, which will involve having the page being capable of taking the user to other pages, interact with videos, etc.
